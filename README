The DCDivx and PocketDivx players are released as a free openSource Projects under the GPL License.  The terms of this license
can be found in in GPL.txt.

These players include other GPL software from the following products:

MAD MP3 decoder - thanks much to Rob Leslie for the best MP3 decoder I have used.
FFMPEG - from which we use pieces of code to accomplish mpeg-1 and Divx 3.x decoding.
OpenDivx - from which our Divx decoder is derived

While we have optimized the above projects for DreamCast and PocketPC we give full credit to the hard work that the people
behind those projects put in to make theirs and our projects possible.
